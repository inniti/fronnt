## Building a connector

The simplest way of implementing a connector is by using
the [@fronnt/create-connector initializier package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fronnt/create-connector)
.

```shell
npm init @fronnt/connector@latest
```

This will setup an example connector project using TypeScript and tools for bundling the connector to use it in your
fronnt projects.
